# Train Delay Estimation
A first attempt to model the train delays across stations in India.

## Description
This project is first of its kind, an attempt made to learn the delay trends of
Indian trains at their in-line stations. We collected Train Running Status data
(with format same as that shown in [NTES](https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/))
