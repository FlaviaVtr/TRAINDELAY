#
# Desc: This file trains the Random Forest Regressor models for different
#       stations. Refer the reademe.txt in models/rfr_models/ to figure out the
#       correct combination of models and corresponding columns removed. Change
#       the directory arguments in the line where joblib is used to dump the
#       *.sav models.
#
#       Prints the RMSE of data frame on which training was done to see the fit.
#
#       To run this file execute:
#       python rfr_stn_models_training_file.py 1
#
#       where the numeral "1" can be changed as <1|2|3|4|5> as per the value of
#       "n" in n-previous-station models. The output trained models are saved in
#       "nps_rfr_labenc_models" directory, where n can be <1|2|3|4|5>.
#
#       IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure to remove the unwanted columns in data frame
#                       depending on experiments for which you want trained
#                       models. This can be done in function:
#                       "remove_unwanted_columns_df()" in "utilities/tt_utils.py".
